# sovrin-sip

This repo is a one-way fork of [indy-hipe](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe).
It holds Sovrin Improvement Proposals (SIPs) for processes or behaviors
that are important to standardize on the Sovrin network. This might
encompass particular choices in the [trust framework](
https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-trust-framework/),
procedures for update, algorithms for steward selection, and so forth.
Such SIPs have numbers >= 5000.

Core technology issues probably belong in the [indy-hipe](
https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-hipe)
repo instead. See [derivative networks](derivative-networks.md) for
details.
