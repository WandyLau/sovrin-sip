# sovrin-rfc

This repo is a one-way fork of [indy-rfc](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-rfc).
It holds RFCs (Requests for Comment) for processes or behaviors
that are important to standardize on the Sovrin network. This might
encompass particular choices in the [trust framework](https://sovrin.org/library/sovrin-trust-framework/),
procedures for update, algorithms for steward selection, and so forth.
Such RFCs have numbers >= 5000.

Core technology issues probably belong in the [indy-rfc](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-rfc)
repo instead. See [derivative networks](derivative-networks-and-rfcs.md) for
details.
